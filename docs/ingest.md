# Ingest log — Project Buddy

## 10/9/2026, 7:15:00 PM

Did you clone the repo on your VM?
Yes — it's cloned at ~/workspace/projects/buddy-tree on my VM (the folder kept the old name when the repo was renamed to buddy-system). Remote points to
GI
GitHub - davedellaquila/buddy-system
github.com
Heads up on something though: there's another worker (Astrid) active in the repo right now. She just pushed a commit that reverted my chevron fix — we're back to the old behavior where clicking a Projects row both toggles expand/collapse and opens the buddy panel.
You asked for clean separation (chevron toggles, row opens). Want me to re-apply my fix, or do you prefer the combined behavior she restored?
You:
Astrid, huh? Where'd that name come from?
Honestly, I don't know — that's just the author name on the git commits (Astrid <astrid@local>). It's another worker that's been active in the repo tonight, committing alongside my work.
I first noticed it when it swept up some of my uncommitted edits mid-task earlier. I don't have any more context than the commit history shows.
Want me to dig into what else it's been changing, or should we just make sure we're not stepping on each other's toes going forward?
You:
Honestly that's a little spooky
Yeah, I get that. An unknown name popping up in your repo's commit history with no explanation is unsettling.
Here's what I can tell you for sure:
The commits are coming from somewhere with write access to your repo
They're happening tonight, around the same time we're working
I don't know who or what "Astrid" is — it's not me, and I don't have visibility into other workers
What I don't know: whether you (or someone you trust) set this up, whether it's another AI assistant in a different chat, or something else entirely.
Want me to pull the full list of Astrid's commits tonight so we can see exactly what it's been touching? And if you don't recognize it, we should probably figure out how it's getting access — because right now it can push to your repo, which means it has your GitHub credentials or a token from somewhere.
You:
Yeah dig into that a little bit more. I'm curious where that came from

So how will the repo find out about your URL?
Two pieces, both already in place:
The registry entry — in buddies.json, my buddy record has "homepage": "astro/". That's how the dashboard knows I have a homepage and where to load it from.
The actual file — astro/index.html in the repo. GitHub Pages serves it at davedellaquila.github.io/buddy-system/astro/.
So when you click on me in the sidebar and Project Homepage is active, the dashboard reads homepage: "astro/" from the registry, resolves it against the site root, and loads the page. No magic — just the registry pointing at a file that exists.
