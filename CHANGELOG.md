# Changelog

All notable changes to the Buddies dashboard and buddy system. Newest first.
`FEATURES.md` describes the current state; this file describes how it got there.

## 2026-10-10 (Clickable tiles, plans tiles, red trash icon, token gating)

### Added
- **Nancy Buddy homepage** — warm living-dossier theme (cream paper, terracotta accents) with attention list, "Who Nan is" fact cards, $1,200/mo grocery stipend panel (under review, linked to the tracker sheet), and interactive notes / reminders / important dates / gift-ideas boards (localStorage). Unknowns stay unknown — relationship to Dave remains unstated.
- **Clickable summary tiles** (Dave's idea) — clicking a tile filters the
  list below to matching items; clicking the active tile again clears the
  filter. Works on Projects (TO REVIEW / NEW / CLEARED), Changelog
  (change types), Business Plans (statuses), and Manifest (AUTOMATIC /
  PLANNED).
- **Business Plans tiles** (Dave's idea) — the Plans page now opens with
  per-status tiles (LIVE, ACTIVE, BRIEF REVIEW, EXPLORING, PLANNED, DRAFT).

### Changed
- **Red monochrome trash icon** (Dave's request) — photo delete and dump
  delete now use a low-fidelity red trash-can SVG; dump edit uses a
  matching monochrome pencil SVG (replacing the ✕/✏️/🗑️).
- **Edit/delete gated on GitHub token** (Dave's request) — photo delete and
  dump edit/delete icons are hidden when no GitHub token is saved.

## 2026-10-10 (Manifest tiles, homepage full-bleed, tile widths, grippers)

### Added
- **New-Project Manifest tiles** (Dave's idea) — the Manifest now opens
  with AUTOMATIC (8) and PLANNED (2) tiles, and every manifest row carries
  a colored pill (green Automatic, amber Planned) identifying its status.
- **Homepage navigation from the tree** (Dave's idea) — when the Project
  Homepage view is selected, clicking a buddy loads its homepage in the
  main view if it has one; buddies without a homepage leave the view
  untouched.

### Changed
- **Project Homepage is full-bleed** (Dave's idea) — the homepage iframe
  now fills the entire main view area with no margins; the header bar is
  replaced by a floating "Open in a new tab" pill button overlaid at the
  top.
- **Plans renamed to Business Plans** in the Views list (Dave's request).
- **Projects tiles constrained to content width** (Dave's request) — the
  TO REVIEW / NEW / CLEARED tiles now match the 860px buddy list below
  instead of spanning the full page width.

### Fixed
- **Resize grippers stay fixed** (Dave's request) — the left sidebar and
  right panel grippers now use sticky positioning so they stay vertically
  centered in the visible area while the panels scroll.

## 2026-10-10 (Tiles: attention on Projects, types on Changelog)

### Changed
- **Attention tiles moved to the Projects page** (Dave's idea) — the
  TO REVIEW / NEW / CLEARED tiles now sit atop the Projects view with
  global counts across all buddies, instead of the Project Homepage.
- **Changelog tiles show change types** (Dave's idea) — the Changelog now
  opens with one tile per change type present in the journal (NOTE EDITS,
  PHOTOS, MOVES, RENAMES, BRAND), each with its count, replacing the
  attention tiles there.

## 2026-10-10 (Panel persistence, project tiles)

### Fixed
- **Views-list selection is independent** — the highlighted view now only
  changes when the user picks a view (view-menu click or number-key
  shortcut). Buddy/plan selection and panel open/close never move it;
  tracked in a dedicated `S.view` instead of deriving it from `S.sel`.

### Fixed
- **View-menu clicks no longer dismiss the buddy panel** — picking any
  option in the top view menu (Tree, Projects, Plans, Manifest, Project,
  Changelog) now leaves the right-side detail panel exactly as it was.
  Panel visibility is controlled only by buddy selection (click/Escape/✕).
  The Project view renders into its own dedicated center container, so a
  homepage and an open panel coexist.
- **Narrow center after panel resize** — plan and buddy center views no
  longer inherit the resized panel's inline width.

### Added
- **Project stat tiles** — the Project view now opens with three tiles:
  TO REVIEW (unseen attention items), NEW (added in the last 7 days),
  CLEARED (reviewed & cleared), in the card style Dave picked. The data
  behind the tiles is a first guess and easy to rewire.

## 2026-10-10 (Repo renamed buddy-tree → buddy-system)

### Changed
- **Repo renamed** — `davedellaquila/buddy-tree` is now
  `davedellaquila/buddy-system`; the live dashboard moved to
  https://davedellaquila.github.io/buddy-system/ (the old URL 404s).
  Code, registry, and docs references updated.

## 2026-10-10 (Buddy homepages)

### Added
- **Buddy homepages** — any buddy can now carry a `homepage` (URL loaded in
  the center Project view), `homepageSource` (the canonical Muse URL, shown
  as an "Open on Muse ↗" link), and `homepageSynced` (mirror date). Buddies
  without a homepage keep the built-in detail page in the Project view.
- **Work Buddy homepage live** — the Project view for Work Buddy now loads
  its Muse-created homepage, mirrored into the repo at `work-buddy/` (the
  muse.ai page blocks third-party iframes, so the self-contained export is
  hosted on Pages and framed same-origin). The canonical
  https://muse.ai/s/work-buddy-hg5xrxhxqexi2xzxv stays one click away.

## 2026-10-10 (Factory reset: symmetric sidebars)

### Changed
- **Reset to Factory Defaults now restores symmetric sidebars** — both
  the left sidebar and the right buddy-detail panel return to the
  default 308px width.

## 2026-10-10 (Changelog row layout)

### Changed
- **Changelog rows stack title over detail** — the timestamp moved to the
  end of the title line (small, muted); the diff sits underneath, flush
  left with the title, full width. No more three-column jaggedness.

## 2026-10-10 (Theme setting)

### Fixed
- **Dark mode actually dark** — the theme's `:root` variables were circular
  self-references (`--bg:var(--bg)`), so dark mode rendered as light. `:root`
  now holds the real dark palette and the light overrides are complete.
  System setting is honored again.
- **Right panel width clamped** — the buddy detail panel can no longer be
  resized (or reset) to a huge width; max is 560px.
- **Buddy clicks open the right overlay panel** — clicking a buddy in the
  sidebar (or arrow-keying to one, or picking from search) now opens its
  details in the narrow right overlay panel, not the wide center view.
  The center view is for the main views; buddy details live on the right.
- **Projects-view chevrons** — chevrons now render only on rows that have
  children (no more dead chevrons on leaf rows), and clicking one reliably
  collapses/expands its section (toggle moved into the central click
  handler so row navigation can't swallow it).
- **Centered changelog** — the changelog content is now centered in the
  viewport (max-width 760px) instead of hugging the left edge.
- **Keyboard nav split** — arrow keys now move only through the buddy
  (project) rows: up/down steps through them, left jumps to the first,
  right to the last. The view buttons (Tree, Projects, Plans, Manifest,
  Changelog) are reached with number keys 1–9 instead of sharing the
  arrow-key list.
- **Theme picker moved to settings** — the Light/Dark/System switch now
  lives in the settings panel (where settings belong), not under the
  sidebar brand.
- **Settings panel upgrades** — footer buttons (Reset/Update/Done) are now
  sticky (always visible while the field list scrolls); the panel is
  draggable by its header and resizable from the bottom-right corner, with
  position and size persisted per device.

### Added
- **Light / Dark / System theme** — a three-way segmented picker under
  the sidebar brand. Persisted per device in localStorage (default:
  System). System follows the OS setting live via matchMedia, and a
  pre-paint script applies the theme before first render (no flash).
- **CSS-variable theming** — all 34 dashboard colors are now semantic
  variables (`:root` = dark, `html.light` = GitHub-light palette);
  every view (tree, projects, plans, manifest, buddy pages, changelog,
  sidebar, sheets, toasts) themes consistently. The old partial
  `prefers-color-scheme` media query was replaced.

## 2026-10-10 (Changelog restyle)

### Changed
- **Changelog view restyled as an activity feed** — entries are grouped
  by day under "Today" / "Yesterday" / month-day headers; each row has
  a type icon (notes, moves, renames), a bold headline, the old → new
  diff as a quiet truncated sub-line, and a small muted time-only stamp
  (full date on hover). Generous padding and dividers replace the
  cramped rows.

## 2026-10-10

### Added
- **Project view** — a fifth main view. Clicking any buddy in the left
  sidebar now selects it as the current project and shows its homepage in
  the center via the Project view (replaces the earlier direct
  buddy-center behavior, which is retired). The selected project's row
  stays highlighted in the sidebar. Keyboard shortcuts 1–6 follow the
  current view order.
- **Changelog view** — a sixth main view listing the full change history
  (the journal), newest first, each with old → new values.
- **Rearrangeable main views** — the gear/settings sheet has a "Main
  views" section; drag to reorder Tree, Projects, Plans, Manifest,
  Project, Changelog. Number-key shortcuts and arrow-key cycling follow
  the order.
- **Arrow keys cycle views and buddies** — with focus outside inputs,
  Up/Down move through view buttons then buddy rows as one sequence
  (last view ↓ → first buddy; first buddy ↑ → last view). Down-arrow
  inside the search box jumps to the first buddy in the filtered list.
- **What Changed shows old → new** — every journal entry displays its
  before → after values (buddy names resolved for moves, long notes
  truncated).

### Changed
- **Reviewed changes stay reviewed** — expanding "What changed?" marks
  entries seen; the sticky bar only reappears for new, unreviewed
  changes. Full history remains in the Changelog view.
- **Dismiss button** — the journal sticky bar's small ✕ is now a labeled
  "Dismiss" button on the right edge.
- **Right detail-panel resize +1px** — hit area 12→13px and gripper
  7→8px wide. (The left sidebar gripper was briefly widened to 10px by
  an automated commit; restored to its original 7px — only the right
  side was requested to grow.)

### Fixed
- **Settings panel was completely broken** — it threw on open
  (missing `SETTING_DEFS`/`getSetting`/`resetToFactory`/`updateFactory`,
  modal never appended to the document, Escape listener duplicated per
  open, `renderTree()` didn't exist). All repaired; Reset/Update Factory
  Defaults now snapshot and restore hideBuddyWord, field order/hidden,
  and view order.
- **Projects expand/collapse never rendered** — `renderProjects()` (with
  per-project › chevrons and persisted collapse state) only ran when the
  user had reparented buddies; the boot path restored static HTML
  without chevrons. The Projects view now always renders with working
  expand/collapse.

## 2026-10-09

### Fixed
- **Duplicate sidebar rows** — the nav's top-level filter included Project
  Buddy's direct children *and* the recursive render nested them under
  Project Buddy, so every direct child (and its subtree) appeared twice
  (e.g. searching "nan" showed Nancy and Finance twice). Top level now only
  lists parentless buddies; children render once, nested.
- **"What it does" → "About"** — the mission field's label renamed on the
  buddy page and in field settings.

### Added
- **Sidebar opens buddies in the center** — clicking a buddy in the left
  sidebar (or arrow-keying through the list) now shows that buddy's
  homepage in the central view instead of a right-side overlay. Clicks
  from the tree, Projects list, and other in-content links still open the
  overlay peek panel; Prev/Next and breadcrumb links follow whichever
  presentation is active. The panel resize handle is hidden in center
  mode.
- **Repo slug eyebrow** — the small label above the buddy name on the
  detail page now shows the buddy's true Git repo slug from the registry
  (e.g. `buddy-tree`), in monospace with a tooltip naming the full
  `davedellaquila/<repo>` path. Buddies with no repo linked honestly show
  "no repo linked" instead of a name-derived guess. (Previously it showed
  the display name, which reads as "Project" with the Hide-"Buddy" setting
  on.)
- **Per-dump actions** — every ingest dump tile now has edit (✏️) and
  delete (🗑️) buttons in its upper-right corner (trash on the far right,
  pencil to its left). Edit opens the full text inline and auto-saves as
  you type (debounced, with a Saving…/Saved status line — same treatment
  as shared notes); delete asks for confirmation. Both work against the
  buddy repo's `docs/ingest.md` and the localStorage fallback, preserving
  timestamps and the file header.
- **No more phantom highlighting** — text selection disabled on the chart
  tiles (was leaving blue selection blocks when panning/zooming).
- **Sidebar buddy search** — filter the buddy list by keywords (AND match
  on name + tagline); press `/` to jump to the search box.
- **Global token pill** — GitHub token status lives in a fixed top-right pill
  (amber 'Token needed' / green 'GitHub check'), not buried per-buddy; saving
  shows a green checkmark confirmation.
- **Zoom presets** — keys `1`–`9` jump to 10%–90% zoom, `0` is 100%.
- **Edge-to-edge chart** — the chart viewport now fills the usable area
  with no surrounding margins; the border sits at the edges.
- **Token gating** — shared notes, ingest, and photo upload are now
  disabled until a GitHub token is saved; a prominent amber banner on every
  buddy page pushes for the token.
- **Zoom keyboard shortcuts** — `+`/`=` zoom in, `-`/`_` zoom out,
  `0` resets to 100%.
- **Zoom slider floats over the chart** — moved from the margin into the
  chart area itself, map-control style. (`94948af`)
- **Chart viewport polish** — visible border around the chart viewport so its
  edges are clear; the viewport now fills the available page height instead
  of clipping. (`f6aa25c`)
- **Responsive layouts** — three breakpoints: small (<640px) stacks tiles as
  full-width cards with a drawer sidebar (hamburger) and detail as a bottom
  sheet; medium (640–1100px) has a collapsible sidebar, horizontal segmented
  view control, and detail as a right-docked side sheet; large (>1100px) is
  tri-pane with a persistent detail panel. **⛶ Fit button** next to the zoom
  slider zooms to fit content. Tile child counts. Keyboard navigation
  (arrows move between buddies, Esc closes detail). (`d606e04`)
- **Standalone buddy mode** — hash deep-links (`#/buddy:<id>`, `#/view:tree`,
  `#/plan:<id>`) with working back/forward; chromeless standalone view
  (`#/buddy:<id>/standalone`) hiding the sidebar; **💾 Save to desktop**
  button on every buddy page downloading a `.webloc` (Mac) / `.url`
  (Windows) launcher that opens the buddy by itself. (`d406f51`)
- **Gripper handles (⠿)** on every tree tile — drag a buddy onto another to
  reparent it; loop protection included. (`8bdbdea`)
- **Orphaned buddies section** — parentless buddies render in their own tree
  section with grippers instead of being invisible. (`8bdbdea`)
- **Ingest box** on every buddy page — brain-dump raw thoughts; each dump
  appends a timestamped entry to the buddy's repo `docs/ingest.md`
  (device-local fallback). (`79e4ae2`)
- **Sharing Buddy** — new buddy (brief, repo, thread, registry entry)
  exploring per-buddy share links, access levels, and privacy. (`4f19bc2`)
- **FEATURES.md** — living feature registry in the repo root. (`d1f4ea2`)
- **README + docs/brief.md sweep** — 25 buddy repos stamped with a README
  (name, mission, brief links) and `docs/brief.md` (full brief text); the
  new-project drill now does this automatically for every new repo, along
  with an empty `docs/ingest.md`.
- **Dream Buddy repo link** — wired `davedellaquila/dream-buddy` into the
  dashboard registry. (`86c3c5e`)

### Fixed
- **Grab-to-pan** — the chart pan was half-built (scrolled a non-scrollable
  element and the whole page). Rewrote it: the tree is now a real scroll
  viewport with grab/grabbing cursors, a 5px click threshold, and
  click-suppression after drags. (`6776cd1`)
- **Shared notes without a token** — the field is now disabled with an amber
  warning instead of silently failing. (`7839093`)

### Changed
- **Tree chart is a scroll viewport** (part of the pan fix) — bounded height,
  pans in any direction once content overflows.
